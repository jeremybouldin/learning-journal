                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                    Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to
                    get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and
                    meet like-minded peers.

                <p><strong> How I stay committed to learning </strong></p>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to
                    spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
                    projects using what I learned or work new techniques into
                    existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                    what I was learning and most things about my journey with
                    the world.
                </p>
                <p><strong>How I got started</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal
                    site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After
                    each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect
                    on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I
                    learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
                    posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn
                    and stay motivated.
                </p>
